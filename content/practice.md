> Ch'i Kung (qigong) practice is expressed in four fundamental disciplines: sitting mediation; Wu Chi Chi Kung (Wuji Qigong), or "standing mediation;" I Ch'uan (yiquan), or "intention practice;" and Tai Chi Ch'uan (taijiquan). We begin with sitting meditation and Wu Chi Ch'i Kung. Ch'i Kung, literally "practice of vital energy", helps us break through a lifetime of old habits and programmed patterns of behavior and movement, allowing what is essential in us to come forth. This practice cultivates chi (qi), breaks down blocks to the free flow of ch'i throughout the body, and integrates the upper and lower body. I Ch'uan (or "intention practice") develops our ability to direct ch'i, through focusing the intention. In the broader sense, this practice develops our ability to focus the mind for improved concentration, creativity, and productivity.From stillness, we begin to move. Practice of the 108 moves of the Tai Chi Ch'uan long form further develops ch'i and i, builds strength in movement, stamina, and the ability to relax in strength. At the highest level of practice, the movements of the form become informed or filled by ch'i.

### Your Health and Wellness

> It's difficult to be healthy in an unhealthy environment, and unfortunately we live in an unhealthy environment. Through the diligent practice of Ch'i Kung, we cultivate our ch'i, which then begins to flow freely throughout the body, strengthening the weak points and reinforcing the strong points, and providing a defense against the insults of air pollution, toxins in our foods and water, and the stresses of our fast-paced lives.

### Self Defense and the Mind

> A mind that is free and at peace will recognize immediately either a kindness or an aggression, correctly interpreting and responding appropriately at once to any touch, whether that touch is physical, mental, or spiritual. In this sense our practice is a martial art; our goal is to increase our sensitivity to and awareness of outside forces that affect us physically, mentally, or spiritually. The cultivation of ch'i enhances our alertness, agility, and sensitivity.
