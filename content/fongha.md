### Sifu Fong Ha

> Sifu Fong Ha has been practicing Chinese internal arts since his childhood and has studied with many renowned teachers. He began his studies of Yang-style Taijiquan in 1953 with Tung Ying-chieh, and continued with Yang Sau-chung, the eldest son of Yang Cheng-fu. Fong’s exploration then led into the realm of I Ch’uan. One of the few I Ch’uan teachers in the West, Fong Ha is well known for his power, graciousness, and cosmopolitan charm. With humor and insight, he encourages students to be true to themselves, to recognize their inner strengths, develop at their own pace, and actualize their potentials. He directs the Integral Chuan Institute in Berkeley, California and teaches nationally and internationally. He is the author of Yiquan and the Nature of Energy: The fine art of doing nothing and achieving everything (Berkeley: Summerhouse Publications, 1996). He also produced the video, Stillness in Movement: The Practice of T’ai Chi Chuan with Master Fong Ha (Vision Arts Video, 1996)

### Don Stringham

> I met Sifu Fong Ha in 1998 in Berkley, CA.  Previously, I had been searching for a teacher who had learned Taijiquan in China.  I picked up the book [Warriors of Stillness](https://www.amazon.com/Warriors-Stillness-Meditative-Traditions-Chinese/dp/B009BJ9FP2/ref=sr_1_8?crid=3GXUSGE7O5NMJ&keywords=jan+diepersloot&qid=1639503539&sprefix=jan+die%2Caps%2C181&sr=8-8) and saw a picture of Sifu Fong Ha and knew I needed to meet him.  Researching on the internet I was able to find his cell number and reached out to him.  He first taught me *Wuji Standing* and *Taiji Ruler*.  The following year and every year after that he came to Salt Lake City, UT and gave two day workshops.  Truly, I miss my mentor and teacher.
