      <description>About Us  Just as the rosebud contains within it the innate form of the perfect flower, so do we all contain within ourselves the innate form of our own perfection. Under the proper conditions of sun, water and nutrients, the bud unfolds to reveal the rose. Likewise the simple conditions of the practice helps us break through a lifetime of old habits and programmed patterns of posture and movement, allowing what is essential in us – physically, mentally and spiritually – to naturally unfold.</description>

      <description>Sifu Fong Ha  Sifu Fong Ha has been practicing Chinese internal arts since his childhood and has studied with many renowned teachers. He began his studies of Yang-style Taijiquan in 1953 with Tung Ying-chieh, and continued with Yang Sau-chung, the eldest son of Yang Cheng-fu. Fong’s exploration then led into the realm of I Ch’uan. One of the few I Ch’uan teachers in the West, Fong Ha is well known for his power, graciousness, and cosmopolitan charm.</description>
