      <description>&lt;p&gt;Baduan literally means “eight sections” and jin, “brocade”.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Like most popular traditions in any culture the origins of Baduanjin are shrouded in myth and legend. Some say they began several thousands of years ago. There are, in fact, historical records of exercises that resemble Baduanjin dating back 4000 years to the time of the Yao settlements. An exciting piece of evidence was unearthed in the late 1970’s known as the Dao Ying Xing Qi Fa (Method of Inducing Free Flow of Chi). This silk book dates from the Western Han Dynasty and contains 44 drawings of men and women from different social classes in exercise postures very similar to Baduanjin.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Taiji Ruler</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Taiji Chih or Ruler (no relationship with Taijiquan) is a sacred and secret qigong first made public in 1954 by Master Zhao Zhong-dao. It is called the Ruler (Chi, sometimes spelled Chih) because during the basic exercise the hands are held about a foot apart. You may practice this qigong while holding a foot-long “Ruler” between the palms. The Ruler is made of a light porous wood such as willow and rounded at both ends so it fits comfortably in the hands. The physical ruler encourages the flow of ch’i. The Taiji Chih system consists of gentle rocking and swaying movements that build ch’i in the feet, the dantian, and the hands. It can be used for self-healing or as a preparation for any form of massage therapy or therapeutic touch. Your hands will feel warm, vibrating, full of healing power after a few minutes’ practice. In the United States, several bizarre variations to the Ruler have become popular, many with little relationship to Zhao’s original techniques. The method we present here at Daoyin Chuan has been handed down from direct students of Zhao, several second- or third generation students, and then corroborated by comparison with Zhao’s original Chinese text.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;DaMo or Bodhidharma, an Indian holy man, came to China where he came upon the Shaolin Temple. While there he noticed the deplorable state of health the monks had. DaMo then went into seclusion into a natural rock cave for nine years. During that time he invented a form of ch’i-kung called Yijinjing (meaning “Muscle/Tendon Transformation”). And though DaMo certainly must have drawn upon his Indian yoga techniques in inventing Yijinjing, what he actually did was combine his own internal kung fu theory to the already existing Chinese theory of qigong, while taking the differences in Chinese physiology and physical environment into account. Chinese ch’i-kung was actually invented independently approximately 3,000 years ago, curiously enough also by a religious leader, Lao Tze, the founder of Taoism.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A very simple and effective approach to meditation is called Wuji Qigong in Chinese. Its core is standing meditation. Loosely translated, “Qigong” means “energy work” and “wuji” means “void” or “emptiness.” The two pillars of this practice are to still the mind and the body. Once we are into the silence of the mind, the void or empty mind, we begin to sense the natural state of our being.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Wuji Qigong may be practiced while either sitting or standing. In either position, the three harmonies are an essential part of this practice. The three harmonies are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Avail yourself of the force of the universe, and bring your instinctive ability into full play.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These are the words of Wang Xiangzhai (1885-1963), founder of the Yiquan system. Yiquan incorporates physical and mental training into one simple system that requires no special equipment or skills. While it is a martial art, it is much more. Yiquan is a complete system of physical and mental cultivation that provides benefits for all. Martial artists who want to refine their skills; those interested in improving their general health, strength and endurance; those interested in healing themselves or recovering from the effects of a past illnesses, injuries or emotional traumas; those engaged in improving their ability to focus their mental energies; or those seeking tranquility in these less than tranquil times.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;philosophy-of-taijiquan&#34;&gt;Philosophy of Taijiquan&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Taijiquan or T’ai-chi ch’uan or “Supreme Ultimate Boxing” is one of the finest products of Chinese philosophy and culture. Based upon the principles of the I Ching and the philosophy of Lao Dze, T’ai-Chi Ch’uan is a system of rounded, fluid, balanced movements to be practiced daily for health and peace of mind. When the movements have been mastered, one’s intrinsic energy developed, and one’s equilibrium stable, the movements and postures of t’ai-chi can be employed to neutralize aggressive actions directed at the self and to counterattack.Among the inner martial arts T’ai-Chi Ch’uan is by far the most popular. T’ai-Chi Ch’uan is practiced by millions of Chinese every day and thousands of Americans. T’ai-chi is a philosophical concept referring to the harmonizing of yin and yang. If yin is the shady slope of the mountain and yang the sunny slope, then t’ai-chi is the peach where they meet.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
